# Shopping List Manager

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a program that allows the user to manage their shopping list. The user should be able to add items to the list, remove items, and view the current list of items.

## Features
- Add items to the shopping list.
- Remove items from the shopping list.
- View the current shopping list.
- Limit the number of items that can be added to the list.

## Instructions

### 1. Create a List to Store Shopping Items
Define an empty list `shopping_list` to store the items.

### 2. Create a Menu Using a While Loop
Use a `while loop` to create a menu of options for the user to add, remove, or view items from the list.

### 3. Add Items to the List
Prompt the user to add items to the list and ensure the number of items does not exceed a certain limit using the `range()` function.

### 4. Remove Items from the List
Allow the user to remove items from the list by specifying the item to remove.

### 5. View the Current List of Items
Use a `for loop` to iterate through the list of items and display them to the user.

### 6. Exit the Program
Allow the user to exit the program by choosing the appropriate option.

### Notes
- Ensure the program handles invalid input gracefully.
- Provide clear prompts and messages to guide the user.
- Consider extending the program to allow for different types of data structures (tuples, sets, dictionaries) to manage the shopping items in various ways.
